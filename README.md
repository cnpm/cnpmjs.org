## What is this?

Private npm registry and web for Enterprise, base on [koa](http://koajs.com/),
MySQL and [Simple Store Service](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpmjs.org/wiki/NFS-Guide).

Our goal is to provide a low cost maintenance and easy to use solution for private npm.

## What can you do with `cnpmjs.org`

* Build a private npm for your own enterprise. ([alibaba](http://www.alibaba.com/) is using `cnpmjs.org` now)
* Build a mirror NPM. (we use it to build a mirror in China: [cnpmjs.org](http://cnpmjs.org/))
* Build a completely independent NPM registry to store whatever you like.

### Features

* **Support "scoped" packages**: [npm/npm#5239](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5239)
* **Simple to deploy**: only need `mysql` and a [simple store system](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpmjs.org/wiki/NFS-Guide).
You can get the source code through `npm` or `git`.
* **Low cost and easy maintenance**: `package.json` info store in MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite or PostgreSQL databases,
tarball(tgz file) store in CDN or other store systems.
* **Automatic synchronization**: automatic synchronization from any registry specified, support two sync modes:
  - Sync all modules from a specified registry, like [npm registry](http://registry.npmjs.org).
  - Only sync the modules that exists in your own registry.
* **Manual synchronization**: automatic synchronization may has little delay, but you can syn immediately by manually.
* **Customized client**: we provide a client [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm)
to extend `npm` with more features(`sync` command, [gzip](https://github.com/npm/npm-registry-client/pull/40) support).
And it easy to wrap for your own registry which build with `cnpmjs.org`.
* **Compatible with NPM client**: you can use the origin NPM client with `cnpmjs.org`,
only need to change the registry in config. Even include manual synchronization (through `install` command).
* **Version badge**: base on [shields.io](http://shields.io/) ![cnpm-badge](http://cnpmjs.org/badge/v/cnpmjs.org.svg?style=flat-square)

**PROTIP** Be sure to read [Migrating from 1.x to 2.x](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpmjs.org/wiki/Migrating-from-1.x-to-2.x)
as well as [New features in 2.x](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpmjs.org/wiki/New-features-in-2.x).
